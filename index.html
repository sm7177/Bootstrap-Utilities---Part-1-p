        <div class="col-8 mt-5">A season is a division of the year based on changes in weather, ecology, and the number of
            daylight hours in a
            given region. On Earth, seasons are the result of the axial parallelism of Earth's tilted orbit around the
            Sun.
            In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches
            the
            Earth's surface, variations of which may cause animals to undergo hibernation or to migrate, and plants to
            be
            dormant. Various cultures define the number and nature of seasons based on regional variations, and as such
            there are a number of both modern and historical cultures whose number of seasons varies.

                <div class="accordion-body">Spring, also known as springtime, is one of the four temperate
                    seasons, succeeding winter and preceding summer. There are various technical definitions of
                    spring, but local usage of the term varies according to local climate, cultures and customs.
                    When it is spring in the Northern Hemisphere, it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere and
                    vice versa. At the spring (or vernal) equinox, days and nights are approximately twelve
                    hours long, with daytime length increasing and nighttime length decreasing as the season
                    progresses until the Summer Solstice in June (Northern Hemisphere) and December (Southern
                    Hemisphere).
                    <br>
                    Spring and "springtime" refer to the season, and also to ideas of rebirth, rejuvenation,
                    renewal, resurrection and regrowth. Subtropical and tropical areas have climates better
                    described in terms of other seasons, e.g. dry or wet, monsoonal or cyclonic. Cultures may
                    have local names for seasons which have little equivalence to the terms originating in
                    Europe.

                    season progresses after the solstice. The earliest sunrises and latest sunsets also occur
                    near the date of the solstice. The date of the beginning of summer varies according to
                    climate, tradition, and culture. When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter
                    in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa.</div>

                seasons on Earth. Outside the tropics, autumn marks the transition from summer to winter, in
                September (Northern Hemisphere) or March (Southern Hemisphere). Autumn is the season when the
                duration of daylight becomes noticeably shorter and the temperature cools considerably. Day
                length decreases and night length increases as the season progresses until the winter solstice
                in December (Northern Hemisphere) and June (Southern Hemisphere). One of its main features in
                temperate climates is the striking change in colour for the leaves of deciduous trees as they
                prepare to shed.

                        and temperate climates. It occurs after autumn and before spring. The tilt of Earth's
                        axis causes seasons; winter occurs when a hemisphere is oriented away from the Sun.
                        Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and some use a
                        definition based on weather.
                        <br>
                        When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere,
                        and vice versa. Winter typically brings precipitation that, depending on a region's
                        climate, is mainly rain or snow. The moment of winter solstice is when the Sun's
                        elevation with respect to the North or South Pole is at its most negative value; that
                        is, the Sun is at its farthest below the horizon as measured from the pole. The day on
                        which this occurs has the shortest day and the longest night, with day length increasing
                        and night length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice.
                        <br>
                        The earliest sunset and latest sunrise dates outside the polar regions differ from the
                        date of the winter solstice and depend on latitude. They differ due to the variation in
                        the solar day throughout the year caused by the Earth's elliptical orbit
